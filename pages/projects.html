          Why join Founders and Coders Academy (FAC) Skills Bootcamp programme.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Becoming a renowned programmer has become a priority to me since the
          year 2016. After a successful simulation and analyzing water quality
          of a particular watershed in Upper Ebonyi River watershed using ArcGis
          (Geographic Information System) and SWAT (Soil and water Assessment
          tool). I became interested in developing such software application for
          solving real-life problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I made a decision to focus in learning how to develop a web
          application since web based application's has tremendously change the
          face of World Wide Web (WWW) and have actually helped solve some
          challenges facing our world today. For instance Uber, Whatsapp,
          Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google map and Twitter has actually
          improved human life in all sphere's.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey to become a fullstack web developer started in the year
          2018 with Andela's learning community. Through that program I learnt
          about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a little bit of reactjs. I was able to
          build small web application using the skills I learnt during the
          program.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, I was opportune to also participated in another Andela's
          learning community sponsored by Facebook using OpenClassRoom as
          learning platform, this program was called facebook development
          circle. At the end of the program I was able to secure a job as a
          junior developer with a step-up company in Lagos Nigeria.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, the reason why I want to join FAC after my research on
          various internet sources on FAC reviews for instance
          <a
            href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/founders-and-coders"
            target="_blank"
            >switchup</a
          >
          I found out it will be a great opportunity to develop my skill-set
          further with FAC bootcamp. I strongly believe that with FAC bootcamp I
          will transform myself and my team to senior developer within a few
          months. Apart from my research on the web about FAC, the first online
          meet-up that was held on 20th November 2022 with Zoom platform was
          astonishing. I was able to hear from the Host <b>Dan</b> and
          <b>Sarah</b> about FAC and the success rate of the applicants in
          Landing a software development job after their Apprenticeship
          position. I would not say I am surprised on their comments that about
          12 applicants in some occasion 11 or 7 applicants secure job
          opportunity, such comments reaffirm my stands about joining FAC
          bootcamp.
