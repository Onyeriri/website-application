          Why join Founders and Coders Academy (FAC) Skills Bootcamp programme.
        </h2>
        <p>
          Software development as part of the information and technology sphere
          has played a significant role in developing web applications through
          web development using web technologies, i.e. HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
          I have always wanted to become a web developer and looking forward to
          joining the Founders and Coders Skills Bootcamp programme to become a
          professional web developer.
        </p>

        <p>
          Becoming a renowned programmer has become a priority for me since the
          year 2016. After a successful simulation and analyzing the water
          quality of a particular watershed in the Upper Ebonyi River watershed
          using ArcGis (Geographic Information System) and SWAT (Soil and Water
          Assessment tool). I became interested in developing software
          applications for solving real-life problems.
        </p>

        <p>
          I decided to focus on learning how to develop a web application since
          web-based applications has tremendously changed the face of the World
          Wide Web (WWW) and have helped solve some challenges facing our world
          today. For instance, Uber, Whatsapp, Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn,
          Google map and Twitter has actually improved human life in all
          spheres.
        </p>

        <p>
          My journey to becoming a full-stack web developer started in 2018 with
          Andela's learning community. Through that program, I learnt about
          HTML, CSS, JavaScript and a few reactjs. I built small web
          applications using the skills I learnt during the program.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, I was opportune to also participated in another Andela's
          learning community sponsored by Facebook using OpenClassRoom as
          learning platform, this program was called facebook development
          circle. At the end of the program I was able to secure a job as a
          junior developer with a step-up company in Lagos Nigeria.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, the reason why I want to join FAC after my research on
          various internet sources on FAC reviews on
          <a
            href="https://www.switchup.org/bootcamps/founders-and-coders"
            target="_blank"
            >switchup</a
          >
          I found out it will be a great opportunity to develop my skill-set
          further with FAC bootcamp. I strongly believe that with FAC bootcamp I
          will transform myself and my team to senior developer within a few
          months.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Apart from my research on the web about FAC, the first online
          meet-up that was held on 20th November 2022 on Zoom platform was
          astonishing. I was able to hear from the Host <b>Dan</b> and
          <b>Sarah</b> about FAC and the success rate of the applicants in
          Landing a software development job after their Apprenticeship
          position. I would not say I am surprised about their comments that
          about 12 applicants in some occasion 11 or 7 applicants secure job
          opportunity, such comments reaffirm my stands about joining FAC
          bootcamp.
